# DataScienceEcosystem
This repository contains my final course assignment notebook titled DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb. The notebook provides a concise overview of essential components in the data science ecosystem and demonstrates how Markdown and Python code can be combined to create a structured, well-documented project.

The main topics covered in this notebook include:

Listing popular programming languages used by data scientists
Listing commonly used data science libraries
Creating a table of open-source development tools
Demonstrating simple arithmetic operations in Python
Converting units, such as minutes into hours
Documenting key objectives and author details

The project also includes screenshots of each exercise as required for submission.
